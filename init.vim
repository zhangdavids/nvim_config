" Description: This is my Neovim configuration which supports Mac, Linux and
" Windows, with various plugins configured. This configuration evolves as I
" learn more about Nvim and becomes more proficient in using Nvim. Since it is
" very long (more than 1000 lines!), you should read it carefully and
" take only the settings and options which suits you. I would not recommend
" downloading this file and replace your own init.vim. Good configurations are
" built over time and take your time to polish.
